.. rubric:: Teaching

:Jan. -- Mar. 2026: `PhD course: Quantum thermodynamics and information <https://www.chalmers.se/en/research/we-train-new-researchers/graduate-courses/FMCC004/>`_ (Chalmers University of Technology)

    Lecturer for one third of the course
    
    (4 lectures and 2 tutorials, each 2 hour long, over 2 weeks).

:Feb. 2024: `Winter school on ultrafast thermodynamics <https://www.chalmers.se/en/current/calendar/f-winter-school-on-ultrafast-thermodynamics/>`_ (Chalmers University of Technology)

    Tutorial session for the lecture "Nanoscale thermodynamics - the role of fluctuations".
.. ~    where students gained hands-on experience and put into practice the notions and concepts about fluctuations in nanoscale systems.


:2017, 2018: Newtonian mechanics for first-year undergraduates (Université Grenoble Alpes, France) 
    
    I supervised tutorials (~20-30 students, 1.5 hours, twice a week) and lab work (~10-15 students, 3.5 hours, once a week). I contributed exercises to the exams and graded examinations and lab work reports.
    
    Program:

        - Collisions
        - Polar coordinates
        - Harmonic oscillators
        - Angular momentum and torque
        
        
.. rubric:: Portfolio

As part of the doctoral course on research and higher education, I have produced a `portfolio (in French) <http://juliette-monsel.byethost15.com>`_.
It documents some of the skills that I acquired during my doctorate and mostly focuses on my teaching.

.. rubric:: Tutor for homework assitance

:2013 -- 2014: Trait d'Union program (Villeurbanne, France)
    
    I supervised and helped students from a high school in a disadvangtaged area do their homework and study (2 hours/week, ~10-20 students)


.. rubric:: Bicycle mechanics instructor

:Since 2020: `Cykelköket <CK_>`_ (Gothenburg, Sweden)

:2018 -- 2020: `uN p’Tit véLo dAnS La Tête <ptitvelo_>`_ (Grenoble, France)


I have been volunteering since 2017 in nonprofit DIY bicycle workshops that aim at promoting cycling, learning mechanics and reusing of unused bicycles.
First, I learned bicycle mechanics by going every Wednesday at the "volunteer evening" at *uN p’Tit véLo dAnS La Tête*, where we took apart and repaired bikes for the workshop. Then, I also came at normal opening hours to share my knowledge and explain to people how to fix their bikes. I have been doing the same at *Cykelköket Göteborg* since I moved to Gothenburg.
More details about my interest in bicycles: :ref:`Bicycles`.
