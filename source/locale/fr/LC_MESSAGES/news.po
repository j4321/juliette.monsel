"An optomechanical microcavity can considerably enhance the interaction "
"between light and mechanical motion by confining light to a sub-"
"wavelength volume. However, this comes at the cost of an increased "
"optical loss rate. Therefore, microcavity-based optomechanical systems "
"are placed in the unresolved-sideband regime, preventing sideband-based "
"ground-state cooling. A pathway to reduce optical loss in such systems is"
" to engineer the cavity mirrors, i.e., the optical modes that interact "
"with the mechanical resonator. In our work, we analyze such an "
"optomechanical system, whereby one of the mirrors is strongly frequency-"
"dependent, i.e., a suspended Fano mirror. This optomechanical system "
"consists of two optical modes that couple to the motion of the suspended "
"Fano mirror. We formulate a quantum-coupled-mode description that "
"includes both the standard dispersive optomechanical coupling as well as "
"dissipative coupling. We solve the Langevin equations of the system "
"dynamics in the linear regime showing that ground-state cooling from room"
" temperature can be achieved even if the cavity is per se not in the "
"resolved-sideband regime, but achieves effective sideband resolution "
"through strong optical mode coupling. Importantly, we find that the "
"cavity output spectrum needs to be properly analyzed with respect to the "
"effective laser detuning to infer the phonon occupation of the mechanical"
" resonator. Our work also predicts how to reach the regime of nonlinear "
"quantum optomechanics in a Fano-based microcavity by engineering the "
"properties of the Fano mirror."

"Self-oscillations are the result of an efficient mechanism generating "
"periodic motion from a constant power source. In quantum devices, these "
"oscillations may arise due to the interaction between single electron "
"dynamics and mechanical motion. Due to the complexity of this mechanism, "
"these self-oscillations may irrupt, vanish, or exhibit a bistable "
"behavior causing hysteresis cycles. We observe these hysteresis cycles "
"and characterize the stability of different regimes in single and double "
"quantum dot configurations. In particular cases, we find these "
"oscillations stable for over 20 seconds, many orders of magnitude above "
"electronic and mechanical characteristic timescales, revealing the "
"robustness of the mechanism at play. The experimental results are "
"reproduced by our theoretical model that provides a complete "

"Coupling a single spin to high-frequency mechanical motion is a "
"fundamental bottleneck of applications such as quantum sensing, "
"intermediate and long-distance spin-spin coupling, and classical and "
"quantum information processing. Previous experiments have only shown "
"single spin coupling to low-frequency mechanical resonators, such as "
"diamond cantilevers. High-frequency mechanical resonators, having the "
"ability to access the quantum regime, open a range of possibilities when "
"coupled to single spins, including readout and storage of quantum states."
" Here we report the first experimental demonstration of spin-mechanical "
"coupling to a high-frequency resonator. We achieve this all-electrically "
"on a fully suspended carbon nanotube device. A new mechanism gives rise "
"to this coupling, which stems from spin-orbit coupling, and it is not "
"mediated by strain. We observe both resonant and off-resonant coupling as"
" a shift and broadening of the electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR), "
"respectively. We develop a complete theoretical model taking into account"
" the tensor form of the coupling and non-linearity in the motion. Our "
"results propel spin-mechanical platforms to an uncharted regime. The "
"interaction we reveal provides the full toolbox for promising "
"applications ranging from the demonstration of macroscopic "
"superpositions, to the operation of fully quantum engines, to quantum "
"simulators."

"Periodically driven quantum dots can act as counterparts of cyclic "
"thermal machines at the nanoscale. In the slow-driving regime of "
"geometric pumping, such machines have been shown to operate in analogy to"
" a Carnot cycle. For larger driving frequencies, which are required in "
"order to increase the cooling power, the efficiency of the operation "
"decreases. Up to which frequency a close-to-optimal performance is still "
"possible depends on the magnitude and sign of on-site electron-electron "
"interaction. Extending our previous detailed study on cyclic quantum-dot "
"refrigerators [`Phys. Rev. B 106, 035405 (2022) "
"<https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.106.035405>`_], "
"we here find that the optimal cooling power remains constant up to weak "
"interaction strength compared to the cold-bath temperature. By contrast, "
"the work cost depends on the interaction via the dot's charge relaxation "
"rate, as the latter sets the typical driving frequency for the onset of "
"non-geometric pumping contributions."

"Increasing the interaction between light and mechanical resonators is an "
"ongoing endeavor in the field of cavity optomechanics. Optical "
"microcavities allow for boosting the interaction strength through their "
"strong spatial confinement of the optical field. In this work, we follow "
"this approach by realizing a sub-wavelength-long, free-space "
"optomechanical microcavity on-chip fabricated from an (Al,Ga)As "
"heterostructure. A suspended GaAs photonic crystal mirror is acting as a "
"highly reflective mechanical resonator, which together with a distributed"
" Bragg reflector forms an optomechanical microcavity. We demonstrate "
"precise control over the microcavity resonance by change of the photonic "
"crystal parameters. The interplay between the microcavity mode and a "
"guided resonance of the photonic crystal modifies the cavity response and"
" results in a stronger dynamical backaction on the mechanical resonator "
"compared to conventional optomechanical dynamics."
