"Increasing the interaction between light and mechanical resonators is an "
"ongoing endeavor in the field of cavity optomechanics. Optical "
"microcavities allow for boosting the interaction strength through their "
"strong spatial confinement of the optical field. In this work, we follow "
"this approach by realizing a sub-wavelength-long, free-space "
"optomechanical microcavity on-chip fabricated from an (Al,Ga)As "
"heterostructure. A suspended GaAs photonic crystal mirror is acting as a "
"highly reflective mechanical resonator, which together with a distributed"
" Bragg reflector forms an optomechanical microcavity. We demonstrate "
"precise control over the microcavity resonance by change of the photonic "
"crystal parameters. The interplay between the microcavity mode and a "
"guided resonance of the photonic crystal modifies the cavity response and"
" results in a stronger dynamical backaction on the mechanical resonator "
"compared to conventional optomechanical dynamics."

"Periodically driven quantum dots can act as counterparts of cyclic "
"thermal machines at the nanoscale. In the slow-driving regime of "
"geometric pumping, such machines have been shown to operate in analogy to"
" a Carnot cycle. For larger driving frequencies, which are required in "
"order to increase the cooling power, the efficiency of the operation "
"decreases. Up to which frequency a close-to-optimal performance is still "
"possible depends on the magnitude and sign of on-site electron-electron "
"interaction. Extending our previous detailed study on cyclic quantum-dot "
"refrigerators [`Phys. Rev. B 106, 035405 (2022) "
"<https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.106.035405>`_], "
"we here find that the optimal cooling power remains constant up to weak "
"interaction strength compared to the cold-bath temperature. By contrast, "
"the work cost depends on the interaction via the dot's charge relaxation "
"rate, as the latter sets the typical driving frequency for the onset of "
"non-geometric pumping contributions."

"Nonequilibrium situations where selected currents are suppressed are of "
"interest in fields like thermoelectrics and spintronics, raising the "
"question of how the related noises behave. We study such zero-current "
"charge, spin, and heat noises in a two-terminal mesoscopic conductor. In "
"the presence of voltage, spin and temperature biases, the nonequilibrium "
"(shot) noises of charge, spin, and heat can be arbitrarily large, even if"
" their average currents vanish. However, as soon as a temperature bias is"
" present, additional equilibrium (thermal-like) noise necessarily occurs."
" We show that this equilibrium noise sets an upper bound on the zero-"
"current charge and spin shot noises, even if additional voltage or spin "
"biases are present. We demonstrate that these bounds can be overcome for "
"heat transport by breaking the spin and electron-hole symmetries, "
"respectively. By contrast, we show that the bound on the charge noise for"
" strictly two-terminal conductors even extends into the finite-frequency "
"regime."

"Self-oscillations are the result of an efficient mechanism generating "
"periodic motion from a constant power source. In quantum devices, these "
"oscillations may arise due to the interaction between single electron "
"dynamics and mechanical motion. Due to the complexity of this mechanism, "
"these self-oscillations may irrupt, vanish, or exhibit a bistable "
"behavior causing hysteresis cycles. We observe these hysteresis cycles "
"and characterize the stability of different regimes in single and double "
"quantum dot configurations. In particular cases, we find these "
"oscillations stable for over 20 seconds, many orders of magnitude above "
"electronic and mechanical characteristic timescales, revealing the "
"robustness of the mechanism at play. The experimental results are "
"reproduced by our theoretical model that provides a complete "
"understanding of bistability in nanoelectromechanical devices."
