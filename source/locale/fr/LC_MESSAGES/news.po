"Nonequilibrium situations where selected currents are suppressed are of "
"interest in fields like thermoelectrics and spintronics, raising the "
"question of how the related noises behave. We study such zero-current "
"charge, spin, and heat noises in a two-terminal mesoscopic conductor. In "
"the presence of voltage, spin and temperature biases, the nonequilibrium "
"(shot) noises of charge, spin, and heat can be arbitrarily large, even if"
" their average currents vanish. However, as soon as a temperature bias is"
" present, additional equilibrium (thermal-like) noise necessarily occurs."
" We show that this equilibrium noise sets an upper bound on the zero-"
"current charge and spin shot noises, even if additional voltage or spin "
"biases are present. We demonstrate that these bounds can be overcome for "
"heat transport by breaking the spin and electron-hole symmetries, "
"respectively. By contrast, we show that the bound on the charge noise for"
" strictly two-terminal conductors even extends into the finite-frequency "
"regime."

"We study geometric energy transport in a slowly driven single-level "
"quantum dot weakly coupled to electronic contacts and with strong onsite "
"interaction, which can be either repulsive or attractive. Exploiting a "
"recently discovered fermionic duality for the evolution operator of the "
"master equation, we provide compact and insightful analytic expressions "
"of energy pumping curvatures for any pair of driving parameters. This "
"enables us to systematically identify and explain the pumping mechanisms "
"for different driving schemes, thereby also comparing energy and charge "
"pumping. We determine the concrete impact of many-body interactions and "
"show how particle-hole symmetry and fermionic duality manifest, both "
"individually and in combination, as system-parameter symmetries of the "
"energy pumping curvatures. Building on this transport analysis, we study "
"the driven dot acting as a heat pump or refrigerator, where we find that "
"the sign of the onsite interaction plays a crucial role in the "
"performance of these thermal machines."
