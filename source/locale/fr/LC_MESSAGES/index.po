"Ground-state cooling of mechanical resonators is a prerequisite for the "
"observation of various quantum effects in optomechanical systems and thus"
" has always been a crucial task in quantum optomechanics. In this paper, "
"we study how to realize ground-state cooling of the mechanical mode in a "
"Fano-mirror optomechanical setup, which allows for enhanced effective "
"optomechanical interaction but typically works in the (deeply) "
"unresolved-sideband regime. We reveal that for such a two-sided cavity "
"geometry with very different decay rates at the two cavity mirrors when "
"using an appropriate single-sided coherent feedback, it is possible to "
"cool the mechanical mode down to its ground state within a broad range of"
" parameters. This is possible even if the total optical loss is more than"
" seven orders of magnitude larger than the mechanical frequency and the "
"feedback efficiency is relatively low. Importantly, we show that a more "
"standard two-sided feedback scheme is not appropriate to cooperate with a"
" Fano-mirror system."

"An optomechanical microcavity can considerably enhance the interaction "
"between light and mechanical motion by confining light to a sub-"
"wavelength volume. However, this comes at the cost of an increased "
"optical loss rate. Therefore, microcavity-based optomechanical systems "
"are placed in the unresolved-sideband regime, preventing sideband-based "
"ground-state cooling. A pathway to reduce optical loss in such systems is"
" to engineer the cavity mirrors, i.e., the optical modes that interact "
"with the mechanical resonator. In our work, we analyze such an "
"optomechanical system, whereby one of the mirrors is strongly frequency-"
"dependent, i.e., a suspended Fano mirror. This optomechanical system "
"consists of two optical modes that couple to the motion of the suspended "
"Fano mirror. We formulate a quantum-coupled-mode description that "
"includes both the standard dispersive optomechanical coupling as well as "
"dissipative coupling. We solve the Langevin equations of the system "
"dynamics in the linear regime showing that ground-state cooling from room"
" temperature can be achieved even if the cavity is per se not in the "
"resolved-sideband regime, but achieves effective sideband resolution "
"through strong optical mode coupling. Importantly, we find that the "
"cavity output spectrum needs to be properly analyzed with respect to the "
"effective laser detuning to infer the phonon occupation of the mechanical"
" resonator. Our work also predicts how to reach the regime of nonlinear "
"quantum optomechanics in a Fano-based microcavity by engineering the "
"properties of the Fano mirror."

"Coupling a single spin to high-frequency mechanical motion is a "
"fundamental bottleneck of applications such as quantum sensing, "
"intermediate and long-distance spin-spin coupling, and classical and "
"quantum information processing. Previous experiments have only shown "
"single spin coupling to low-frequency mechanical resonators, such as "
"diamond cantilevers. High-frequency mechanical resonators, having the "
"ability to access the quantum regime, open a range of possibilities when "
"coupled to single spins, including readout and storage of quantum states."
" Here we report the first experimental demonstration of spin-mechanical "
"coupling to a high-frequency resonator. We achieve this all-electrically "
"on a fully suspended carbon nanotube device. A new mechanism gives rise "
"to this coupling, which stems from spin-orbit coupling, and it is not "
"mediated by strain. We observe both resonant and off-resonant coupling as"
" a shift and broadening of the electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR), "
"respectively. We develop a complete theoretical model taking into account"
" the tensor form of the coupling and non-linearity in the motion. Our "
"results propel spin-mechanical platforms to an uncharted regime. The "
"interaction we reveal provides the full toolbox for promising "
"applications ranging from the demonstration of macroscopic "
"superpositions, to the operation of fully quantum engines, to quantum "
"simulators."

"Periodically driven quantum dots can act as counterparts of cyclic "

"geometric pumping, such machines have been shown to operate in analogy to"
" a Carnot cycle. For larger driving frequencies, which are required in "

"possible depends on the magnitude and sign of on-site electron-electron "

"the work cost depends on the interaction via the dot's charge relaxation "
"rate, as the latter sets the typical driving frequency for the onset of "

"Increasing the interaction between light and mechanical resonators is an "
"ongoing endeavor in the field of cavity optomechanics. Optical "
"microcavities allow for boosting the interaction strength through their "
"strong spatial confinement of the optical field. In this work, we follow "
"this approach by realizing a sub-wavelength-long, free-space "
"optomechanical microcavity on-chip fabricated from an (Al,Ga)As "
"heterostructure. A suspended GaAs photonic crystal mirror is acting as a "
"highly reflective mechanical resonator, which together with a distributed"
" Bragg reflector forms an optomechanical microcavity. We demonstrate "
"precise control over the microcavity resonance by change of the photonic "
"crystal parameters. The interplay between the microcavity mode and a "
"guided resonance of the photonic crystal modifies the cavity response and"
" results in a stronger dynamical backaction on the mechanical resonator "
"compared to conventional optomechanical dynamics."

#~ "Nonequilibrium situations where selected "
#~ "currents are suppressed are of interest"
#~ " in fields like thermoelectrics and "
#~ "spintronics, raising the question of how"
#~ " the related noises behave. We study"
#~ " such zero-current charge, spin, and"
#~ " heat noises in a two-terminal "
#~ "mesoscopic conductor. In the presence of"
#~ " voltage, spin and temperature biases, "
#~ "the nonequilibrium (shot) noises of "
#~ "charge, spin, and heat can be "
#~ "arbitrarily large, even if their average"
#~ " currents vanish. However, as soon as"
#~ " a temperature bias is present, "
#~ "additional equilibrium (thermal-like) noise"
#~ " necessarily occurs. We show that "
#~ "this equilibrium noise sets an upper "
#~ "bound on the zero-current charge "
#~ "and spin shot noises, even if "
#~ "additional voltage or spin biases are"
#~ " present. We demonstrate that these "
#~ "bounds can be overcome for heat "
#~ "transport by breaking the spin and "
#~ "electron-hole symmetries, respectively. By "
#~ "contrast, we show that the bound "
#~ "on the charge noise for strictly "
#~ "two-terminal conductors even extends into"
#~ " the finite-frequency regime."
