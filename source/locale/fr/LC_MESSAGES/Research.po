"Thermodynamics was developed in the 19th century to study steam engines "
"using the cyclical transformations of a working substance to extract heat"
" from thermal baths and convert it into work, possibly stored in a "
"battery. This applied science eventually led to the development of "
"fundamental concepts such as irreversibility. Quantum thermodynamics aims"
" at revisiting these results when the working substances, baths and "
"batteries become quantum systems. See for instance the book "
"`Thermodynamics in the quantum regime: fundamental aspects and new "
"directions <https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-99046-0>`_ "
"(most of the chapters can also be found on arXiv) for a review of the "
"field."

"The light field in an optical cavity interacts with a mechanical "
"resonator via radiation pressure. In a typical setup, the cavity has one "
"moving end-mirror which constitutes the mechanical degree of freedom. "
"When the mechanical position varies, the cavity length changes which "
"modifies its resonance frequency. On the other hand, when adding more "
"photons in the cavity, the radiation pressure on the mirror increases, "
"which shifts the resonator's rest position. This optomechanical coupling "
"gives a high degree of control on the dynamics of the mechanical "
"resonator through the cavity, making it possible to use this platform for"
" applications such as ground state cooling, sensing or quantum "
"manipulations of the mechanics. It also makes it of great interest for "
"thermodynamics: work and entropy measurements, heat engines proposals, "

"This is a different kind of optomechanical system where the optical part "
"is a qubit instead of a cavity. The qubit’s transition frequency is "
"modulated by the vibrations of the mechanical system. The mechanical "
"degree of freedom exchanges work with the qubit and therefore behaves "
"like a dispersive battery, i.e. whose natural frequency is very different"
" from the one of the qubit’s transition. The electromagnetic environment "
"of the qubit plays the role of the thermal bath. The fluctuations of the "
"mechanical energy are equal to the fluctuations of work, which allows the"
" direct measurement of entropy production. As a result, hybrid "
"optomechanical systems are promising for experimentally testing "
"fluctuation theorems in open quantum systems."
