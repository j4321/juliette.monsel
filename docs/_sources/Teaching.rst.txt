Teaching experience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. rubric:: Teaching assistant

:2017, 2018: Newtonian mechanics (first-year undergraduates, Université Grenoble Alpes) 
    
    I supervised tutorials (~20-30 students) and lab work (~10-15 students). I contributed exercises to the exams and graded examinations and lab work reports.

    
    Program:

        - Collisions
        - Polar coordinates
        - Harmonic oscillators
        - Angular momentum and torque
        
        
.. rubric:: Portfolio

As part of the doctoral course on research and higher education, I have produced a `portfolio (in French) <http://juliette-monsel.byethost15.com>`_.
It documents some of the skills that I acquired during my doctorate and mostly focuses on my teaching.

    I supervised and helped students from a high school in a disadvangtaged area do their homework and study (2 hours/week, ~10-20 students)


.. rubric:: Bicycle mechanics instructor

:2020 -- current: `Cykelköket Göteborg <CK_>`_ (Gothenburg, Sweden)

:2018 -- 2020: `uN p’Tit véLo dAnS La Tête <ptitvelo_>`_ (Grenoble, France)


I have been volunteering since 2017 in DIY bicycle workshops that aim at promoting cycling, learning mechanics and reusing of unused bicycles.
First, I learned bicycle mechanics by going every Wednesday at the "volunteer evening" at *uN p’Tit véLo dAnS La Tête*, where we took apart and repaired bikes for the workshop. Then, I also came at normal opening hours to share my knowledge and explain to people how to fix their bikes. I have been doing the same at *Cykelköket Göteborg* since I moved to Gothenburg.
