.. admonition::  Optomechanical cooling with coherent and squeezed light: the thermodynamic cost of opening the heat valve
    :class: preprint

    Ground-state cooling of mechanical motion by coupling to a driven optical cavity has been demonstrated in various optomechanical systems. In our work, we provide a so far missing thermodynamic performance analysis of optomechanical sideband cooling. We examine various performance quantifiers to get a full picture of the thermodynamic process and use them to benchmark different experimental platforms.
    Importantly, in addition to the standard optomechanical setup fed by coherent light, we investigate two recent alternative setups: replacing the coherent laser drive by squeezed light or using a cavity with a frequency-dependent (Fano) mirror. 
    
    This work arises from a collaboration between `Janine Splettstoesser's theoretical group <https://sites.google.com/site/splettchalmers>`_ and `Witlef Wieczorek's experimental group <https://wieczorek-lab.com/>`_ to investigate thermodynamics with optomechanical setups.

.. admonition::  Ultrastrong coupling between electron tunneling and mechanical motion
    :class: preprint

    We have measured and modelled the coupling strength between single-electron tunneling and nanomechanical motion in a fully-suspended carbon nanotube device. 
    We have found it to be well within the ultrastrong coupling regime, thus opening exciting perspectives for both fundamental research and quantum technologies.

    This work is part of the FQXI project `Nanomechanics in the solid-state for quantum information thermodynamics <https://fqxi.org/grants/large/awardees/view/__details/2019-IAF/ares>`_.
