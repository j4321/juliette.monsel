I am a researcher in the group `Dynamics and thermodynamics of nanoscale devices <https://sites.google.com/site/splettchalmers/research-group>`_, in the `Applied Quantum Physics Laboratory <https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/mc2/research/applied-quantum-physics/>`_, in the Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience at Chalmers University of Technology, in Gothenburg, Sweden. 

I did my Ph.D. under the supervision of `Alexia Auffèves <https://quantum-energy-team.cnrs.fr/>`_
at the `Institut Néel <https://neel.cnrs.fr/>`_ (CNRS, Université Grenoble Alpes) in Grenoble, France. 
My thesis dissertation, entitled *Quantum Thermodynamics and Optomechanics*, was awarded a Springer Thesis Award and published in 
the `Springer Theses series <https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030549701>`_ in 2020. Since 2020, I have been working with `Janine Splettstoesser <https://sites.google.com/site/splettchalmers>`_ at Chalmers, first as a postdoctoral researcher and, since 2024, as a permanent researcher. I am also collaborating closely with `Witlef Wieczorek's experimental group <https://wieczorek-lab.com/>`_ at Chalmers on cavity optomechanics.
