Bicycle and mechanics
=====================


.. rubric:: Cycling in the city

I adopted the bicycle as my main mean of transportation when I moved to Grenoble. 
I have come to think it is the best one when living in a city, here are a few reasons why:

    - Fast and convenient -- no endless search for a parking spot, no traffic jams, no waiting 20  minutes for the tram at off-peak hours, ... 
    - My favorite way to unwind after work.
    - I can look after and repair my bike myself.
    - Environment friendly.
    - Economical -- no extra insurance, no gas, ...
    
And when it comes to inconveniences like rain, quite common where I currently live (Gothenburg, Sweden), or snow, I have become an adept of the Scandinavian saying

    Det finns inget dåligt väder, bara dåliga kläder.
    
    *There is no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothes.*

However, in the case of cycling, it needs to be extended beyond clothing to include cycling equipment such as suitable tires. 


.. rubric:: Bike kitchens

One thing I like about (non-electrical) bikes is the possibility to repair them oneself. 
I find it really satisfying to be able to diagnose and fix myself most issues I have with my bikes. 
A great place to learn bicycle mechanics is a *Bike Kitchen*, that is a Do-It-Yourself bicyle workshop where one has access to tools, second-hand spare parts and help from volunteers. 
Bike kitchens come with a large variety of structures and operating models (exclusively volunteer-run or with few employees, membership mandatory or not to access the workshop, ... ) 
but they have the common goals of promoting bike riding, reusing and recycling old bikes and teaching bicycle mechanics.
 

I have been a volunteer in two of them:

 - `uN p’Tit véLo dAnS La Tête <http://www.ptitvelo.net>`_ in Grenoble
 - `Cykelköket Göteborg <https://www.facebook.com/cykelkoket.gbg>`_ in Gotheburg

and this is where I learned almost everything I know about bicycle mechanics. 

What I like about bike kitchens:
 
  - Learning more about bicycle mechanics,
  - Helping others,
  - Sharing my knowledge and enpowering people,
  - Meeting and exchanging with people from various cultures and social backgrounds,
  - The conviviality with the other volunteers, e.g. shared meals, evening hangouts, ...

.. rubric:: Travelling

I have also discovered long distance cycling, which is a way of travelling during the holidays that I enjoy. For now I have only done two relatively short trips (I know people who have crossed continents):

    - Châlons sur Sâone - Tours (6 days, ~ 600 km, summer 2019) with this bike:

    - Gothenburg - Helsinborg following `Kattegattleden <https://kattegattleden.se/>`_ (3 days and half, ~ 400 km, summer 2020) with this bike (picture taken during the trip with the luggage on):
