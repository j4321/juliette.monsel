    Periodically driven quantum dots can act as counterparts of cyclic thermal machines at the nanoscale. In the slow-driving regime of geometric pumping, such machines have been shown to operate in analogy to a Carnot cycle. For larger driving frequencies, which are required in order to increase the cooling power, the efficiency of the operation decreases. Up to which frequency a close-to-optimal performance is still possible depends on the magnitude and sign of on-site electron-electron interaction. Extending our previous detailed study on cyclic quantum-dot refrigerators [`Phys. Rev. B 106, 035405 (2022) <https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.106.035405>`_], we here find that the optimal cooling power remains constant up to weak interaction strength compared to the cold-bath temperature. By contrast, the work cost depends on the interaction via the dot's charge relaxation rate, as the latter sets the typical driving frequency for the onset of non-geometric pumping contributions.

.. admonition::  Charge, spin, and heat shot noises in the absence of average currents: Conditions on bounds at zero and finite frequencies

    Nonequilibrium situations where selected currents are suppressed are of interest in fields like thermoelectrics and spintronics, raising the question of how the related noises behave. We study such zero-current charge, spin, and heat noises in a two-terminal mesoscopic conductor. In the presence of voltage, spin and temperature biases, the nonequilibrium (shot) noises of charge, spin, and heat can be arbitrarily large, even if their average currents vanish. However, as soon as a temperature bias is present, additional equilibrium (thermal-like) noise necessarily occurs. We show that this equilibrium noise sets an upper bound on the zero-current charge and spin shot noises, even if additional voltage or spin biases are present. We demonstrate that these bounds can be overcome for heat transport by breaking the spin and electron-hole symmetries, respectively. By contrast, we show that the bound on the charge noise for strictly two-terminal conductors even extends into the finite-frequency regime.

    We have measured and modelled the coupling strength between single-electron tunneling and nanomechanical motion in a fully-suspended carbon nanotube device. We have found it to be well within the ultrastrong coupling regime, thus opening exciting perspectives for both fundamental research and quantum technologies.

    Self-oscillations are the result of an efficient mechanism generating periodic motion from a constant power source. In quantum devices, these oscillations may arise due to the interaction between single electron dynamics and mechanical motion. Due to the complexity of this mechanism, these self-oscillations may irrupt, vanish, or exhibit a bistable behavior causing hysteresis cycles. We observe these hysteresis cycles and characterize the stability of different regimes in single and double quantum dot configurations. In particular cases, we find these oscillations stable for over 20 seconds, many orders of magnitude above electronic and mechanical characteristic timescales, revealing the robustness of the mechanism at play. The experimental results are reproduced by our theoretical model that provides a complete understanding of bistability in nanoelectromechanical devices.

.. admonition::  Geometric energy transport and refrigeration with driven quantum dots

    We study geometric energy transport in a slowly driven single-level quantum dot weakly coupled to electronic contacts and with strong onsite interaction, which can be either repulsive or attractive. Exploiting a recently discovered fermionic duality for the evolution operator of the master equation, we provide compact and insightful analytic expressions of energy pumping curvatures for any pair of driving parameters. This enables us to systematically identify and explain the pumping mechanisms for different driving schemes, thereby also comparing energy and charge pumping. We determine the concrete impact of many-body interactions and show how particle-hole symmetry and fermionic duality manifest, both individually and in combination, as system-parameter symmetries of the energy pumping curvatures. Building on this transport analysis, we study the driven dot acting as a heat pump or refrigerator, where we find that the sign of the onsite interaction plays a crucial role in the performance of these thermal machines.
